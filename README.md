# odin-recipes
This project is the first summary where I will add everything I have learned about HTML creating a basic and simple recipe fora website.
Also I am practicing repositories makeups
I had to get back to git Basics lesson because I dint remembered command lines completly

Commands related to a remote repository:
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
Commands related to the workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
Commands related to checking status or log history
git status
git log
